### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ahmed Tikiwa, a Senior Software Engineer and Android Tech Lead at Luno, a platform that allows customers to securely buy, store, explore and earn cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ripple, Etherium and USD Coin. I am also a co-organizer for the Cape Town Google Developer Group (GDG) as well as a mentor for the Exchange with Google Developers program.

I have been a software engineer since 2010 and an Android Engineer since 2015. Apart from software developement, I also give tech talks at conferences, meetups as well as blog on Medium. Though I love creating applications that help make a difference in people's lives, my passion is to share the knowledge I have gained to my fellow developer community through the aforementioned talks and blogs.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more and more of Jetpack Compose
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Android projects

- âš¡ Fun fact: I also play the piano and I sing in my past time
